## 3x YouTube Browser Extension

***3x YouTube*** is software that locates 
a video element being rendered on any webpage
(designed to target YouTube videos) and modifies
the HTMLMediaElement playbackRate property
with a custom value specified through the
browser extensions user interface. <br/>

By default YouTube has a limit of 2x default speed
when setting custom a playback rate for a video. 
This browser extension allows users to easily set custom 
playback speeds of up to 11x the default value. <br/>
